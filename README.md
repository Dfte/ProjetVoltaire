# ProjetVoltaire

So what happened here is that i had a E-learning class at school that asked us to work at least 15 hours to have the maximum points.
Since i ended up finishing everything in less than 5 hours i know i would be screwed. 

I had two choices :
-Loose 10hours of my life doing nothing
-use this 10 hours to lean Python and then script something 

Well i let you imagine what i decided ahaha!

So this tool is very easy to use, the only thing you have to do is to connect to the projet voltaire page and select the mock exam.
I suggest you use this test because it lasts for a vrey long time.

Launch the script, using your mouse point at the sentence and press Ctrl + C

Now you can leave your computer and it will click automatically :) !

Note that you can use the -t option to specify the time between two clicks so hat it looks "more human".
