# ProjetVoltaire

So what happened here is that I had a E-learning class at school that asked us to work at least 15 hours to have the maximum points.

The goal of that E-learning site is to teach french grammatical rules. To do so, they give you a few sentences, some are right, some are wrong. It's your work to detect which one are wrong or right. If there is a mistake you gotta click on it. Either you click on "No faults".

Since I ended up finishing all tests in less than 5 hours I knew I would be screwed and got less points than my teammate...

I had two choices : <br>
-Loose 10 hours of my life doing tests over and over again <br>
-Use this 10 hours to learn Python and then script something 

Well I let you imagine what I decided ahaha!

So this tool is very easy to use, the only thing you have to do is to connect to the projet voltaire page and select the mock exam.
I suggest you use this test because it lasts for a very long time.

Launch the script using the option -t 150 (will make it more human like). Using your mouse point at the sentence then press Ctrl + C

Now you can get out enjoy the sun since your computer will click automatically at the exact point you selected :) !.
