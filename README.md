# ProjetVoltaire

So what happened here is that i had a E-learning class at school that asked us to work at least 15 hours to have the maximum points.
Since i ended up finishing everything in less than 5 hours i knew i would be screwed and got less points than my teamate...

I had two choices :
-Loose 10 hours of my life doing tests over and over again 
-Use this 10 hours to learn Python and then script something 

Well i let you imagine what i decided ahaha!

So this tool is very easy to use, the only thing you have to do is to connect to the projet voltaire page and select the mock exam.
I suggest you use this test because it lasts for a vrey long time.

Launch the script and using your mouse point at the sentence then press Ctrl + C

Now you can get out enjoy the sun since your computer will click automatically at the exact point you selected :) !

Note that you can use the -t option to specify the time between two clicks so hat it looks "more human".
